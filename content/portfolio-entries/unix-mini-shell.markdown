##The Assignment
For the Unix course at WWU, we create a mini shell. It's implemented in 6 different assignments that all build nicely off of each other ([the assignment series](http://cs.wwu.edu/faculty/phil/classes/s12/352/)). Along the way, we are required to use Unix tools for development such as gdb, vim, valgrind, and CVS.

##Features Overview
 * Comments
 * Built-In commands
 * Nested command and variable expansion
 * Signal Processing
 * Pipelining
 * Input and output redirection

###Etc.
The features overview above is fairly high-level - there are a lot of details that can be seen in the assignment series.

Source code is available on request.
