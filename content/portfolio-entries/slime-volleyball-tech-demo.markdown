##The Project
I worked on this application before my internship began during the summer of 2011. At the time, their were no Android apps based on the "internet classic" Slime Volleyball. I used it as an opportunity to learn about the Android platform and its libraries.

##Techniques Learned
Over the course of the project I learned about multitouch, efficient game loops, Android's drawing APIs, and improved my ability to implement 2D physics engines. This was also when I began experimenting with TCP/IP networking which I later used in my app Linux-to-Android-Expose (which can be found on my github).
